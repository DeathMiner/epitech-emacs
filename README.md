# epitech-emacs
A simple script to install {EPITECH.} configuration for the emacs editor.

## Installation

I bet you guessed it's pretty obvious. Anyway here's a sum up of what you'll have to do if you are too lazy to DIY:

1. `git clone https://github.com/demaisj/epitech-emacs.git`
2. `cd epitech-emacs`
3. `./INSTALL.sh`
4. Enjoy.

## Fun Fact

*An older version of this script was in the files of Epitech's new 2017 Fedora dump (the not working `confemacs` command).*

It has now been heavily modified by Epitech's staff and so replaced by a version that was compliant to the new coding style. The official files of the script are available on the intranet (files -> technical documentations), but i'm still providing a mirror here for easier access & posterity.
