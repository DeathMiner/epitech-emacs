# epitech-emacs
A simple script to install {EPITECH.} configuration for the emacs editor.

## Installation

I bet you guessed it's pretty obvious. Anyway here's a sum up of what you'll have to do if you are too lazy to DIY:

1. `git clone https://github.com/DeathMiner/epitech-emacs.git`
2. `cd epitech-emacs`
3. `./INSTALL.sh`
4. Enjoy.

## Fun Fact / Dump Troubleshooting

**This script is in the official files of Epitech's new Fedora dump as of September 2017!**

Run the `confemacs` command to see it in action.

*Obviously*, the new dump is still a "*bocal quality*" OS even if it does not have the "*blinux*" name. So the script won't work out of the box. **To make it work, type `cd /usr/share/confemacs` first, then enter the `confemacs` command.**

Want to know why? This script was designed to be executed in its own folder, not from everywhere inside your system. *Voil√†.*

***GG BOCAL!***
